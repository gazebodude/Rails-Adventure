# Rails-Adventure

This is a choose your own adventure style storytelling app based on Ruby on Rails.
That said, this is mainly a personal project to get my feet wet with RoR, Github, etc.

## Project Aims

* Allow users to dynamically create and navigate through a narrative tree.

* Get my head around Ruby on Rails, github & related stuff.
